# serverless-presentation

### This repository is intended for educational purposes.

The presentation can serve as a starting point for the use of serverless computing.
For that see `presentation.pdf`.

Furthermore, there are several examples of how a serverless application can look like (on a small scale).
Take a look in `./examples/*`.

Pull requests that expand or improve the content are always welcome.
